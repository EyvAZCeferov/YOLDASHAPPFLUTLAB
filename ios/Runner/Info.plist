Furthermore, our app enables users to communicate with each other within the app. Should users choose to share their location with the other party during this conversation, they have the option to do so explicitly within the chat feature. We prioritize user privacy and do not share location data without explicit consent. Rest assured that we highly value your privacy and have implemented robust security measures to safeguard your location information. Your data is encrypted and securely stored, and we do not disclose it to any third parties without your explicit consent.</string>
